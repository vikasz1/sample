    <h3><b>1.</b> How would you describe yourself?</h3>
    <p>When interviewers ask you to talk about yourself, they’re looking for information about how your qualities and characteristics align with the skills they believe
         is required to succeed in the role. If possible, include quantifiable results to demonstrate how you use your best attributes to drive success.</p>
    
    <h3>What makes you unique?</h3>    
    <p>Employers often ask this question to identify why you might be more qualified than other candidates they’re interviewing. To answer, focus on why hiring you 
        would benefit the employer. As you don’t know the other applicants, it can be challenging to think about your answer in relation to theirs. Addressing why your
         background makes you a good fit will let employers know why your traits and qualifications make you well prepared.

    <h3>Why do you want to work here?</h3>    
    <p>Interviewers often ask this question as a way to determine whether or not you took time to research the company and to learn why you see yourself as a 
        good fit. The best way to prepare for this question is to do your homework and learn about the products, services, mission, history and culture of this
         workplace. In your answer, mention the aspects of the company that appeal to you and align with your career goals. Explain why you’re looking for these 
         things in an employer.
